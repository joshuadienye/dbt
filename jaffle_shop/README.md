# Jaffle Shop

## Introduction
This project is my take on the popular dbt test project `Jaffle Shop`. More information about the Jaffle Shop project can be found [here](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop/blob/main/README.md).

## What is Jaffle?
A jaffle is a toasted sandwich with crimped, sealed edges. Invented in Bondi in 1949, the humble jaffle is an Australian classic. The sealed edges allow jaffle-eaters to enjoy liquid fillings inside the sandwich, which reach temperatures close to the core of the earth during cooking. Often consumed at home after a night out, the most classic filling is tinned spaghetti, while my personal favourite is leftover beef stew with melted cheese.
